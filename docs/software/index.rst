   firmware

The LMS8001 Companion board is supported by the :doc:`lms8suite` software, which provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for configuring and managing the its settings. The :doc:`firmware <firmware>` for the onboard STM32F105 microcontroller is also available for customisation.

Work is also underway to integrate support for LMS8001 Companion into the `Lime Suite NG`_ software, which will enable a single driver stack to manage both the LimeSDR and LMS8001 Companion hardware together. This will allow for seamless operation and configuration of the combined system.
