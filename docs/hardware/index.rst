The :doc:`overview` page provides a high-level summary of the hardware design and components locations, while the :doc:`detailed` page takes a look at the various blocks and connector pinouts. The :doc:`changelog` documents the revision history and updates made to the board over time.

The hardware design files, including schematics and PCB layouts, are available in the `LMS8001 Companion GitHub repository`_. 

.. attention::
   Owners of original limited production boards from 2017 should consult the `LMS8001 Companion 2v1 Documentation`_ for details on that version, as it differs from the current design.
